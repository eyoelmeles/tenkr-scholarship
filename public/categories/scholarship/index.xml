      <description>&lt;p&gt;Applications for Charles Darwin University RTP Scholarship in Australia for 2025 are now being accepted. The recipients of these fully funded scholarships must enroll in Higher Degree by Research program at Charles Darwin University between January 6, 2025, and March 31, 2025. The Research Training Program (RTP) offers block grants to higher education providers (HEPs) to support local and international students to pursue research doctorates and research masters degrees, which are also known as higher degrees by research (HDRs). Both degrees have funding available for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objectives of the RTP are to provide flexible funding arrangements to support training of  students undertaking HDRs at Australian HEPs. The purpose of this international scholarship for Masters and PhD students is to teach skills which are necessary to develop a career in academic and various other sectors of the labour markets. It also supports collaboration between HEPs and industry and other research stakeholders. The skills learned will be helpful for students which will make them empowered and capable of doing great things in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through its fully funded scholarship in Australia for international students, CDU is dedicated to giving students great research opportunity. The university, corporations, government, and community organizations give scholarships to help students with the cost of their education. In addition to covering research expenses not directly covered by Australian competitive grants and other sources, the Research Support Program (RSP) funds HEPs for systemic research costs like libraries, labs, consumables, computing centers, and the salaries of support and technical staff. The sponsorship will help you to focus on your research and study rather than worrying about the research expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In CDU scholarship for international and local students, you can study a wide range of disciplines as part of your research degree which include health, Environment and livelihood, Engineering and Information Technology, Education and Arts, Social and Public Policy, Business and Law, Disaster Management, Humanities, Social Sciences and languages, Tropical Agriculture, Aquaculture and Biosecurity. While submitting your application, you have to choose a research project and a potential research supervisor from Charles Darwin University who will assist you throughout your research project. This is an incredible fully funded research scholarship which has so many benefits that will almost end your financial burden of studying in a foreign university.&lt;/p&gt;
