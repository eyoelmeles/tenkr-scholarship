        <p>In the summer of 2025, The Mandela Washington Fellowship 2025 in USA will bring up to 700 young leaders to the United States for an extensive executive-style program aimed at developing skills and enabling Fellows to take on leadership roles in their communities and industries. Selected fellows will participate in a six-week Leadership Institute at a U.S. college or university where they will share their experiences with U.S citizens and other African Fellows and learn from them.</p>
<p>In this fully-funded fellowship, Fellows will have the opportunity to explore various industries other than their daily work which will help to expand their expertise and strengthen their skills. Other than this, fellows will be able to meet with U.S. Government Officials and renowned business leaders. This US exchange program will enhance your work with the help of new connections, skills, and ideas. After the event will end, fellows can join the global Alumni Network that will be useful for them to look for creative solutions to most common problems.</p>
<p>You will have a life-changing experience from this leadership program. Through this fellowship for Africans, participants will establish powerful networks with both Africans and Americans. You‚Äôll be able to regain your self-confidence and motivation to give back to your community. Students will be studying Business, Civic Engagement, or Public Management hosted by U.S. colleges or universities which will add to their existing knowledge and teach them new concepts.</p>
